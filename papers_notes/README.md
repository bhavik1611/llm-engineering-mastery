# Papers Notes

## Purpose of Paper Notes

This folder stores summaries and analyses of research papers relevant to the LLM engineering journey. Notes serve to:

- Capture key contributions and mathematical insights
- Support literature-driven understanding of transformer architectures, training methods, and applications
- Provide reference material for interviews and deeper dives

## Template for Reading Research Papers

Use this structure for each paper note. Create a separate file per paper (e.g., `attention_is_all_you_need.md`).
