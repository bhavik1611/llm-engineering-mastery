# Phase 4: Applications

## What This Phase Is About

Phase 4 applies LLMs to practical systems: tool-using agents, multi-agent coordination, and a capstone project that integrates prior learning. The focus shifts from model internals to system design, API integration, and end-to-end evaluation.

## Mathematical Focus

- Tool selection: parsing model output, mapping to tool calls
- Multi-agent: communication protocols, role allocation, consensus
- Capstone: depends on project choice (e.g., RAG + agent, evaluation metrics)

## Engineering Focus

- Agent loops: prompt, generate, parse, execute, iterate
- Tool interfaces: input/output schemas, error handling
- Multi-agent orchestration: state management, turn-taking
- Deployment considerations: latency, cost, robustness

## Expected Competencies After Completion

- Implement an agent that selects and invokes external tools
- Design a multi-agent system with defined roles and communication
- Complete a capstone project with clear design, implementation, and evaluation

## Milestones in This Phase

| Milestone | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| M12 | Tool Agent |
| M13 | Multi-Agent System |
| M14 | Capstone Project |

## Exit Criteria

You have completed Phase 4 when:

- [ ] M12: Agent correctly parses intent, selects tools, and uses outputs in the loop
- [ ] M13: Multi-agent system operational with defined protocol
- [ ] M14: Capstone project fully documented with design, implementation, and evaluation
