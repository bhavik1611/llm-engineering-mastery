# M14: Capstone Project

## Problem Statement

Complete a capstone project that integrates concepts from Phases 1-4. The project should demonstrate end-to-end LLM engineering: from model selection or training, through fine-tuning or RAG if relevant, to deployment or evaluation. Define a clear problem, design a solution, implement it, and document results.

## Mathematical Formulation

(Placeholder: depends on project choice; e.g., RAG retrieval scoring, agent reward design, or evaluation metrics)

## Intuition

(Placeholder: depends on project choice)

## Implementation Plan

1. Define problem: what real-world task does this address?
2. Scope: what is in scope and out of scope?
3. Design: architecture, components, data flow
4. Implementation: build core components
5. Evaluation: define metrics, run experiments
6. Documentation: design doc, README, results summary
7. Reflection: what worked, what would you change?

(No code.)

## Required Experiments

- Define evaluation protocol
- Run baseline and proposed approach
- Document metrics and qualitative results
- Ablate key design choices if applicable

## Required Visualizations

- System architecture diagram
- Evaluation results (tables, plots)
- Example inputs and outputs

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the hardest part of the project?
2. How would you scale this for production?
3. What would you do differently with more time?

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] Design document (architecture, components)
- [ ] Implementation complete
- [ ] Evaluation results in `experiments_log.md`
- [ ] README or summary in milestone folder
