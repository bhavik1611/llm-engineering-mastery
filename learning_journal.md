# Learning Journal

## Purpose

This journal captures reflections, conceptual syntheses, and corrected misconceptions from the LLM engineering journey. It serves as:

- A record of how understanding evolved over time
- A resource for interview preparation and portfolio discussions
- A forcing function for deep processing of concepts

## How Entries Should Be Written

- **Concise:** No filler. Each sentence should add information.
- **Rigorous:** Reference mathematics and code where relevant.
- **Honest:** Document confusion, mistakes, and breakthroughs.
- **Actionable:** Note what was unclear and what resolved it.

## Reflection Template

Use this structure for each journal entry:

```
## Entry: [Date] — [Topic/Milestone]

### What I learned
- [Bullet points summarizing key insights]

### What was difficult
- [Stumbling blocks, confusions, or areas that required extra effort]

### What I would do differently
- [Changes to approach if starting over]

### Connections to prior work
- [How this relates to previous milestones or concepts]

### Open questions
- [Things still unclear or worth revisiting]
```

## Example Entry Structure

```
## Entry: YYYY-MM-DD — M2 Neural Network from Scratch

### What I learned
